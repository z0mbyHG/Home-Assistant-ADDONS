## 🧪 Architecture & Status

- **amd64**: tested and working
- **arm64**: should work, but **not yet fully tested**

ARM64 support is implemented (Java + server are architecture-aware),
but real-world feedback is highly appreciated.

👉 If you are running this add-on on **ARM64 hardware**
(e.g. Home Assistant Green, Raspberry Pi 64-bit),
please consider testing it and sharing your results.

## ❤️ Feedback & Support

This add-on is developed and maintained in my free time.

If you try it out:
- feedback
- bug reports
- improvement suggestions
- ARM64 test results

are very welcome and highly appreciated.
