🔍 How to find FTB Pack IDs and Version IDs

To install an FTB modpack, you need two values:

Pack ID

Version ID

Both can be found on the official Feed The Beast website.

📦 Find the Pack ID
Open the official FTB modpack list:

👉 https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks
Click on the modpack you want to use.
Look at the URL in your browser.
Example:
https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/97-ftb-one

👉 The number after /modpacks/ is the Pack ID
In this example:
Pack ID = 97

🧩 Find the Version ID
On the modpack page, open the Versions tab
or go directly to:
https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/<PACK_ID>/versions

Click on the version you want to use.

Check the URL:
https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/97-ftb-one/versions/100069

👉 The last number in the URL is the Version ID
In this example:
Version ID = 100069

⚠️ Important Note
Using:
version_id: 0
means “latest version”, but this can cause connection issues if the client and server are not on the exact same version.

✅ Recommendation:
Always set a fixed version_id for stable and reliable connections.

## 📜 Logs

- **Live output** is shown directly in the Home Assistant Add-on log
- Full persistent log is written to:

This makes debugging crashes or startup issues much easier.
